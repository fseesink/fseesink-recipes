# fseesink-recipes

My recipes for AutoPkg.  I am blatantly mirroring [homebysix's repo](https://github.com/autopkg/homebysix-recipes) to speed things up here, and eventually I will share this repo with the AutoPkg org and migrate things there.  I just need to make sure things are solid first.

If you use these recipes, click the ![Star](README-images/star.png) button above to show your support!

Many of these recipes were created with the aid of [Recipe Robot](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot), an app you should definitely check out.


## Installation

To add my repo to your Mac (with AutoPkg and Git already installed), run this command:

```
autopkg repo-add fseesink-recipes
```


## Dependencies

Currently none of my recipes have parent recipes that live in another repo, as I am using Recipe Robot for most of these.  But this may change in the future.  If/when that time comes, I will make note of it here.


## Known issues

If you're having a problem with one of my recipes, [check the issues](https://github.com/autopkg/fseesink-recipes/issues) to see whether a known problem exists. If not, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/autopkg/fseesink-recipes/issues/new) so I can investigate.


## Submissions

Forks/pulls/issues are welcome. I'm always learning/tweaking.  But be patient with me.
